# Pooled Cell Painting Image Processing System Requirements

## 1. System Overview

This document outlines requirements for a next-generation system for processing, analyzing, and managing high-throughput microscopy data from cell painting and barcoding experiments. The system will orchestrate complex image processing workflows, manage computational resources efficiently, and provide mechanisms for both automated and manual intervention during the processing pipeline.

## 2. Core Requirements

- **Must support detailed stitching configuration**:
  - `overlap_pct`: Image overlap percentage between fields
  - `stitchorder`: Tile arrangement strategy based on acquisition pattern
  - `tileperside`: Number of tiles along each side of the stitched grid
  - `final_tile_size`: Pixel dimensions of output tiles
  - `round_or_square`: Well shape for cropping calculations

  - Offset parameters for alignment troubleshooting
  - `compress`: Output file compression settings

### 2.3 Workflow Control

- **Must support fully automated end-to-end processing** with configurable pipeline sequences.

- **Must enable manual intervention at any stage** with the ability to:
  - Pause/resume pipeline execution
  - Inspect intermediate results before proceeding
  - Modify parameters between stages
  - Re-run specific stages with adjusted settings

- **Must track processing state** across all pipeline stages to enable resuming from interruptions.

### 2.4 Compute Resource Management

- **Must efficiently manage computational resources** appropriate to each processing stage:
  - Scale resources based on workload
  - Optimize resource allocation for memory-intensive vs. CPU-intensive tasks
  - Support parallel processing of independent tasks

- **Must work across diverse compute environments**:
  - Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
  - On-premises high-performance computing clusters
  - Local workstations (with appropriate scaling)

### 2.5 Data Management

- **Must organize input and output data** in a consistent, browsable structure.

- **Must track data provenance** including:
  - Processing history for each image
  - Parameters used at each stage
  - Software versions and dependencies

- **Must handle large data volumes** (terabytes) efficiently with appropriate streaming and caching strategies.

### 2.6 User Interaction

- **Must provide multiple interaction mechanisms**:
  - Command-line interface for scripting and automation
  - Web-based or desktop GUI for visualization and control
  - Programmatic API for integration with other systems

- **Must support both expert and non-expert users** with appropriate levels of abstraction and guidance.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 System Architecture

- **Must implement a modular architecture** with:
  - Clear separation between workflow orchestration, execution, and configuration
  - Well-defined interfaces between components
  - Plugin system for extensibility

- **Must support distributed processing** across multiple compute nodes.

- **Must be resilient to failures** with appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### 3.2 Configuration System

- **Must implement a multi-layered configuration approach** separating:
  - Experimental parameters (what data to process and how)
  - Computational resource parameters (how much compute power to allocate)
  - Infrastructure parameters (where the processing will occur)

- **Must validate configuration** against schema to catch errors early.

- **Must allow configuration overrides** at different levels (system, experiment, batch, plate).

### 3.3 Cross-Platform Support

- **Must run on Linux, MacOS, and Windows** operating systems.

- **Must provide consistent interfaces** across platforms.

- **Must accommodate platform-specific resources** (GPU acceleration, memory limits).

### 3.4 Extensibility

- **Must allow addition of new processing tools** beyond CellProfiler.

- **Must support custom analysis modules** for specialized experiments.

- **Must enable integration with external systems** via APIs and data exchange formats.

### 3.5 Documentation and Support

- **Must provide comprehensive user documentation** including:
  - Installation and setup guides
  - Configuration reference
  - Workflow tutorials
  - Troubleshooting information

- **Must include developer documentation** covering:
  - Architecture overview
  - API references
  - Extension guides
  - Development setup

## 4. Implementation Recommendations

### 4.1 System Components

- **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates pipeline steps, manages dependencies, and tracks state.
- **Resource Manager**: Allocates and monitors compute resources across infrastructure.
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles loading, validation, and distribution of parameters.
- **Execution Engine**: Runs image processing tools with appropriate parameters.
- **Data Manager**: Organizes and tracks files throughout the processing pipeline.
- **User Interfaces**: CLI, GUI, and API implementations for system interaction.

### 4.2 Key Technical Approaches

- **Container-Based Deployment**: Package tools and dependencies in containers for consistent execution.
- **State Management**: Persist workflow state to enable resumption after interruptions.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use events to coordinate pipeline progression and notifications.
- **Distributed Computing**: Implement task distribution for parallel processing.
- **Pluggable Storage**: Support multiple storage backends (local, network, cloud).

### 4.3 User Experience Considerations

- **Progress Visualization**: Provide clear indication of pipeline progress and estimated completion.
- **Result Browsing**: Enable navigation and inspection of intermediate and final results.
- **Error Handling**: Present clear error messages with actionable remediation steps.
- **Parameter Exploration**: Support interactive adjustment of processing parameters.

## 5. Migration Path

To facilitate transition from the current AWS-based implementation:

- **Phase 1**: Implement core processing capabilities with equivalent functionality.
- **Phase 2**: Add manual intervention capabilities and enhanced user interfaces.
- **Phase 3**: Extend to non-CellProfiler tools and additional compute environments.
- **Phase 4**: Optimize performance and add advanced features.

The system should maintain backward compatibility with existing data formats and configuration parameters where possible, while providing clear migration paths for legacy experiments.
