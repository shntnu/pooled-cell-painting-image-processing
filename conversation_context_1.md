# Pooled Cell Painting Image Processing Project Context

## Primary Request and Intent
The original request was to analyze the pooled-cell-painting-image-processing repository and create detailed documentation. This included understanding the codebase architecture, pipeline flow, and technical implementation to produce clear documentation for new developers.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Pooled Cell Painting: Combines genetic perturbations (CRISPR) with high-content imaging
- AWS Serverless Architecture: Orchestrates complex image processing workflows
- AWS Lambda: Coordinates pipeline steps and manages metadata
- AWS Batch: Runs computationally intensive CellProfiler jobs
- Amazon S3: Stores images and processing results
- Amazon SQS: Manages job queues and progress tracking
- CellProfiler: Image analysis software with pipeline-based processing
- CSV-Driven Pipelines: Uses LoadData module to configure CellProfiler operations
- Illumination Correction: Compensates for uneven microscopy illumination
- Image Segmentation: Identifies cellular compartments (nuclei, cells, cytoplasm)
- Barcode Calling: Translates fluorescent signals to sequence data
- Image Alignment: Registers images across channels and cycles
- Image Stitching: Creates whole-well montages from tiled acquisitions

## Files and Code Sections

### Lambda Functions
- `/lambda/PCP-1-CP-IllumCorr/lambda_function.py` through `/lambda/PCP-9-Analysis/lambda_function.py`
- `/lambda/lambda_functions/helpful_functions.py`: Common utilities for AWS interactions
- `/lambda/lambda_functions/create_CSVs.py`: Functions for generating CellProfiler input files
- `/lambda/lambda_functions/run_DCP.py`: Handles AWS Batch job configuration

### CellProfiler Pipelines
- `/pipelines/12cycles/1_CP_Illum.cppipe`: Illumination correction calculation
- `/pipelines/12cycles/2_CP_Apply_Illum.cppipe`: Applying correction and cell segmentation
- `/pipelines/12cycles/3_CP_SegmentationCheck.cppipe`: Validation of segmentation
- And 6 more specialized pipelines for barcoding and analysis

### Documentation & Configuration
- `/docs/PCP_Lambda_table.csv`: Configuration parameters for Lambda functions
- `/docs/overview.png`: Pipeline workflow diagram
- `/docs/Technical_Implementation_Overview.md`: System architecture explanation
- `/docs/CellProfiler_Pipeline_Details.md`: Detailed pipeline explanations
- `/CLAUDE.md`: Code style guidelines for the repository
- `/README.md`: Comprehensive repository overview

## Completed Work
- Created CLAUDE.md with code style guidelines
- Created Technical_Implementation_Overview.md describing system architecture
- Created CellProfiler_Pipeline_Details.md with pipeline details and configuration
- Updated README.md with comprehensive repository information

## Potential Next Steps
- Create additional tutorials or examples for new users
- Further document notebook and QC components
- Provide more detailed explanation of FIJI scripts for stitching
- Develop deeper documentation of troubleshooting processes for pipeline failures
- Validate documentation with users to identify gaps or areas needing clarification
- Create a comprehensive troubleshooting guide
